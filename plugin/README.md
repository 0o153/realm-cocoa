# Realm Plugin

The Realm Plugin for Xcode installs file and class templates to simplify Realm development in Xcode. It will add a menu item under 'File' in Xcode that will let you quickly open the Realm Browser. This assumes you have a compiled version of the Realm Browser on your system. You can find it on realm.io.

To install the Realm Plugin, open `RealmPlugin.xcodeproj` and Build. This will prompt for your password. Restart Xcode to gain access to the templates and the menu item.
