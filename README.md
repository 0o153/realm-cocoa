# Realm for iOS & OSX

![Logo](logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables. This repository holds the source code for the iOS & OSX versions of Realm.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations
* **Simple:** Add persistence to your apps in minutes
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and even Swift (experimental)

## Setting up Realm in your app

There are two ways to set up Realm in your app: manually or with CocoaPods.

Manually:

1. Download the [latest release of Realm](http://static.realm.io/downloads/ios/latest) and extract the zip (or [build it from source](#building-realm)).
2. Drag Realm.framework from our release and into the Frameworks folder in your project in Xcode.
   Make sure **Copy items into destination groupâ€™s folder** is selected and press **Finish**.
3. Click on the project in the Xcode file explorer.
   Select your target and go to the **Build Phases** tab. Under **Link Binary with Libraries** press + and add **libc++.dylib**.

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

1. Add the following to your Podfile: `pod "Realm"`.
2. From the command line, run `pod install`.
3. Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project!

Once your app is set up with Realm, our [documentation](#documentation) will guide you to unleash its full potential.

## Documentation

Documentation for Realm can be found at [realm.io/docs/ios](http://realm.io/docs/ios). The API reference is located at [realm.io/docs/ios/latest/api](http://realm.io/docs/ios/latest/api).

## Building Realm

Prerequisites:
* Building Realm requires Xcode 5 or above
* Building Realm with Swift support requires Xcode6-Beta3 specifically
* Building Realm documentation requires [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc)

Once you have all the necessary prerequisites, building Realm.framework just takes a single command: `sh build.sh ios`. You'll need an internet connection the first time you build Realm to download the core binary.

Run `sh build.sh help` to see all the actions you can perform (build ios/osx, generate docs, test, etc.).
