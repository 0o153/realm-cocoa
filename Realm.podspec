                   Realm is an object framework for iOS. It aims to provide an easier way to handle data in your apps, whether you need in-memory objects, full database persistence, or a simple network cache.
                   Realmâ€™s basic structures look like Objects & Arrays for your language, but provide additional features such as: querying, relationships & graphs, thread safety,easy in/out JSON Mapping & more.
                   A C++ core underneath provides a memory-efficient implementation of these features, with RLMObjects usually consuming less RAM than native Objects. The core also provides an optional persistence layer that can automatically save & retrieve your objects from disk with very high performance.
